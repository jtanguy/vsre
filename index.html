    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p><i>VSRE</i> stands for "very short reply expected".</p> 
    <p>It's a way for you to indicate to the recipients of your email that they have to reply with a short (usually one to five words) reply.</p> 
    <p>Typical replies to VSRE are "Yes", "No", or "Tuesday", or â€œPls send more info".</p>
    <p>It is not a standard, just a human convention, like FYI, or RSVP.</p>

    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>We all get a ton of email. In most cases replying politely can be demanding.</p> 
    <p>But it shouldn't be.</p> 
    <p>When somenone sends you an email with "VSRE" in the subject or the body, he/she is expecting a very short answer.</p>

    <h3>"Expected" or just "Welcome"?</h3>
    <p>This was one of the points debated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5586410">on the original discussion on HN</a>: is the recipent of an email tagged VSRE free to choose between a very short or an extended reply?</p>
    <p>The answer is that the recipient <b>is expected</b> to give a short reply.</p> The reason behind this is that if VSRE indicated that it's up to the recipient to decide, the recipent would be left with two options: 
    <ol>
      <li>a long, polite, answer that fits our existing way of communicating.</li>
      <li>a very short, impolite for some, answer</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>VSRE wants to remove the overhead of going through such a decision process. So, <b>you are expected to give a very short reply</b>. </p>
    <p>Do you want to give a lengthy reply? Go ahead and take the risk, we are humans we don't communicate using well defined protocols. But keep in mind that the sender didn't ask for a lengthy reply.</p>

    <h3>Use it in the email subject.</h3>
    <p>The email subject is the best place to put VSRE, it will probably help the recipent know in advance that this is an email that can be quickly answered.</p>

    <h3>What if the recipient doesn't know what VSRE stands for?</h3>
    <p>You could add a PS stating, "Learn about VSRE, http://vsre.info/".</p>

    <h3>History.</h3>
    <p>The idea was initially described in <a href="http://blog.vrypan.net/2013/4/21/vsre-very-short-reply-expected/">blog.vrypan.net</a>, and triggered a lengthy  discussion on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5586410">news.ycombinator.com</a> and a good number of mentions on twitter, facebook and google+. About a day later, this page was set up.</p>
